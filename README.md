Hello

This is a Repository for an App which is to include in the M5Cardputer Factory Demo App.

It enables the use of the Unit-QR on the extension port.


button f shows the firmware version of the Unit-QR
button m toggles between autoscan and manual scan modes.


Simple but effective.

Runs with standart ESP-IDF 4.4.7 without Arduino Plugin.
